# Customer Churn - Linear-Regression
A simple linear regression model in Python to predict the likelihood that a customer of a financial institution will leave.
This project uses scikit learn's logistic regression to predict the likelihood that a customer will leave a financial institution. It uses a [dataset available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartiksaini18/churn-bank-customer) that contains data for about 10,000 customers.
